# Roulette
This is a personal project that is supposed to simulate a roulette game
As I continue working on this project, I have unexpectedly learned a few good lessons. 
Although the game does run the basics such as creating a function def, while loops, inputs, and if (nested if) statements, this process has also taught me about designing inputs. Although the logic was simple, there were many protocols that needed to be checked for the user. Making sure the user is putting in valid numbers, having no duplicates, no empty bets, and making sure that the program can understand the user inputs (input numbers being ready either as an int or str variables). I discovered and learned how user inputs can be so ambiguous when designing and that data validation is a series of checks. In my code I do want to point out that the isdigit() function only works in this scenario as the numbers are whole numbers ranging 0-36. 

This mini project allowed me to refresh my coding skills and allowed me to actually experiment throughout the process.
